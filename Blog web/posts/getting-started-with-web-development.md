# Getting Started with Modern Web Development

Web development has evolved significantly over the past few years. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to update your skills, this guide will help you understand the modern web development landscape.

## What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It involves several disciplines including:

- **Frontend Development**: The client-side of applications that users interact with
- **Backend Development**: Server-side logic and database management
- **Full-Stack Development**: Combining both frontend and backend skills

## Essential Technologies to Learn

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the foundation of all web pages. It provides the structure and content of websites using elements and tags.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style and layout web pages. It controls the visual presentation of HTML elements.

### JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It's essential for modern web development.

## Modern Development Tools

1. **Code Editors**: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom
2. **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for code management
3. **Package Managers**: npm or yarn for managing dependencies
4. **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, or Parcel for optimizing code
