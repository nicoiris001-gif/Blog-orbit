# Auto-Discovery Test Post

This blog post demonstrates the automatic discovery system. It was created by simply adding a new Markdown file to the `posts/` directory.

## How It Works

The blog system automatically:

1. **Scans for Markdown files** in the posts directory
2. **Parses front matter** to extract metadata
3. **Displays the post** on the homepage immediately
4. **No manual configuration** required

## Benefits

- **Zero Configuration**: Just drop a `.md` file and it appears
- **Automatic Sorting**: Posts are sorted by date automatically  
- **Instant Updates**: New posts show up immediately
- **No Build Step**: Works with static hosting

This makes adding new content as simple as creating a Markdown file!
